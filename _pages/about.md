I am Haojie Wen（温浩杰）. I am curious about how human cognitive capacities and their neural bases emerged, interacted, and evolved to give rise to the modern human brain. This overarching interest motivates my research on more specific questions concerning two core human capacities: the neural basis of tool use and the ways in which language shapes other cognitive functions. I address these questions by combining functional and structural MRI with behavioral experimental approaches, and by studying diverse populations, including macaques (cross-species comparisons), twins (genetic modeling), deaf individuals with different early sign-language exposure, and patients with focal brain lesions. I have also begun preliminary explorations in computational modeling and text analysis.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the School of Systems Science, Beijing Normal University, working with Yanchao Bi (Concept Lab: https://www.psy.pku.edu.cn/bilab/
) and Dahui Wang. I received my Ph.D. in Cognitive Neuroscience from the State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning, Beijing Normal University, under the supervision of Yanchao Bi. Here is my [CV](/files/HaojieWen_cv.pdf).

Outside of work, I enjoy reading; attending live performances (e.g., theatre, Kunqu opera, and stand-up comedy); visiting museums and art galleries; cooking (especially Shanxi noodles); and having long conversations while walking. I am fascinated by all kinds of aesthetic experiences.

## Research Focus
This line of work was developed during my PhD and investigates the structure of semantic knowledge and its variation across populations and historical periods. I combine methods involving:

- cross-linguistic semantic modeling  
- historical and contemporary corpora  
- neuroimaging data  
- cultural and ecological datasets  
- computational approaches to semantic structure  

This work aims to understand both universal constraints and context-dependent variations in meaning representation.

## Recent Work

### Semantic structure across languages
Cross-linguistic analyses of embeddings from 53 languages, semantic ratings across 8 languages, and fMRI data from 45 languages identify shared semantic dimensions and systematic ecological variation.

### Pathogens and semantic variation
Historical and cross-cultural analyses show that higher pathogen severity is associated with increased sensorimotor semantic dimensions in collective language use, both across countries and over the past century.

### Neural encoding of semantic relations
Using graph-based semantic models and fMRI, we show that distinct neural systems encode different structural properties of linguistic relations.
