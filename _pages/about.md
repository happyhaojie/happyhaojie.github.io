I am Haojie Wen（温浩杰）. I am curious about how human cognitive capacities and their neural bases emerged, interacted, and evolved to give rise to the modern human brain. This overarching interest motivates my research on more specific questions concerning two core human capacities: the neural basis of tool use and the ways in which language shapes other cognitive functions. I address these questions by combining functional and structural MRI with behavioral experimental approaches, and by studying diverse populations, including macaques (cross-species comparisons), twins (genetic modeling), deaf individuals with different early sign-language exposure, and patients with focal brain lesions. I have also begun preliminary explorations in computational modeling and text analysis.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the School of Systems Science, Beijing Normal University, working with Yanchao Bi (Concept Lab: https://www.psy.pku.edu.cn/bilab/
) and Dahui Wang. I received my Ph.D. in Cognitive Neuroscience from the State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning, Beijing Normal University, under the supervision of Yanchao Bi. Here is my [CV](/files/HaojieWen_cv.pdf).

Outside of work, I enjoy reading; attending live performances (e.g., theatre, Kunqu opera, and stand-up comedy); visiting museums and art galleries; cooking (especially Shanxi noodles); and having long conversations while walking. I am fascinated by all kinds of aesthetic experiences.
