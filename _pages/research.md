My current research primarily focuses on two distinctive and crucial human cognitive capacities—tool use and language—with the aim of understanding how they are represented in the brain, how they interact with each other, and how they influence other cognitive functions.

# Neural bases of tool use

Tool use is a fundamental human cognitive ability and a key distinction between humans and other animals. Previous studies have identified a dedicated tool-processing network in the human brain. We further found that the neural network supporting tool processing spans both the cortex and the pulvinar, forming a cortico-subcortical brain network [(Wen, 2023, J. Neurosci.)](/files/Wen_2023_JN). This tool-related network appears to be human-specific: it is already present in the neonatal brain but absent in the mature macaque brain [(Wen, 2022, NeuroImage)](/files/Wen_2022_NeuroImage.pdf). Moreover, in collaboration with the Computational Group, we found that dimensional representations can effectively guide tool selection in AI models [(Hao, 2025, preprint)](/files/Hao_2025_preprint.pdf).

**Brain intrinsic connection patterns underlying tool processing in human adults are present in neonates and not in macaques**

Cross-species; resting state functional connectivity; network

**one-sentence information:** Although homologous regions establish an intrinsic tool network in human neonates, this network is absent in macaques; its topology closely mirrors that of adults, with premotor-parietal connectivity playing a central role in its formation.

# Effects of language on other cognitive functions
