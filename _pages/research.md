I am curious about how human cognitive capacities and their neural bases emerged, interacted, and evolved to give rise to the modern human brain. This overarching interest motivates my research on more specific questions concerning two core human capacities: the neural basis of tool use and the ways in which language shapes other cognitive functions.

**Neural bases of technological cognition**


**Effects of language on other cognitive functions**
