My current research primarily focuses on two distinctive and crucial human cognitive capacities—tool use and language—with the aim of understanding how they are represented in the brain, how they interact with each other, and how they influence other cognitive functions.

**Neural bases of tool use**


**Effects of language on other cognitive functions**
